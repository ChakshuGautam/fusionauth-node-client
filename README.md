### Deprecation Warning

This repository has been deprecated in favor of the [fusionauth-typescript-client](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-typescript-client). You can just change your dependency and should have no problems using it with node as the package is still javascript but with additional type information. If you run into problems then let us know over there.

We will continue to publish this package for several more versions before we archive it and fully deprecate its use. Please make arrangements to migrate to the typescript client soon.
